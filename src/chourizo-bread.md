# Chourizo Bread

## Information
- Makes 8 of them.

## Ingredients
- 2.5 cups flour
- 5 teaspoons dry yeast
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 chourizo sausage links cut into slices and casing removed
- 8 tablespoons warm water
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon flour to dust

## Directions:
1. Dissolve the yeast in 4 tablespoons of warm water. Add about 1/2 tablespoon of flour and mix well. Set aside.
2. In a big bowl, mix the flour, olive oil, salt, and the yeast mixture. Add some more warm water a bit at a time until you have a smooth dough that doesn’t stick to your hands. Let rise for 30 minutes.
3. Divide into 8 portions. Using a rolling pin roll out the dough pieces into rectangles.
4. Layer the sliced chouriço on the dough, roll the dough up, and pinch the seams to close.
5. With a knife make 4 horizontal cuts to the top of the dough pieces.
6. Set the pieces aside on a greased baking sheet and let them rise for about another 30 minutes.
7. Dust the tops of the dough pieces with the tablespoon of flour.
8. Bake in a preheated oven at 375 degrees fahrenheit for about 25-30 minutes until the bread is done.
9. Take out of the oven and let them cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve while hot.
