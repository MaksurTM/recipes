# Just★Recipes
Recipe site. The twist is that it only has recipes, like it should!
No cookies. No ads. No life stories. No user accounts. No javascript. Just recipes! 
Currently, recipes are only added via pull request. **Might** add other options in the future.
Recipes are stored as plain text files in the src directory.
